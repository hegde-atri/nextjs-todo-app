* Preface

We now know the very basics of Nextjs 13. Let's make our experience with Next just a bit better. For this we'll be using the [[https://create.t3.gg][create-t3-app]].

This creates a Nextjs app with all the libraries we want - Prisma, Tailwindcss and Next-Auth.
The new part it adds is called tRPC. This "connects" the frontend to the backend for a magical experience.

* Bun

We will be using =bun= instead of =yarn=. I noticed that yarn/npm were quite slow. We are replacing it with =bun=.

Download and run the bun installer.

#+begin_src bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
#+end_src

You might need to add the installation path to your =$PATH=.

You can do this by modifying your =~/.bashrc= file and appending this to the end of it. Replacing =YOUR_USERNAME= with your username ðŸ˜†.

#+begin_src bash
# PATH for bun
BUN_INSTALL="/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.bun"
PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src

Test =bun= works by running =bun -v=.

* Creating our app

Now let's create our project.

#+begin_src bash
bun create t3-app@latest
#+end_src

1. Name your project.
2. Select Typescript
3. Select Yes for Tailwind CSS
4. Select Yes for tRPC
5. Select NextAuth.js as the authentication provider.
6. Select Prisma for database ORM.
7. Select Yes for App Router.
8. Select Yes for Git repo
9. Select Yes for bun install
10. Hit enter leaving the import alias to the default =~/=

Now you can open this folder in your IDE or text editor.
